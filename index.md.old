## [Teaching](./teaching/)

I teach a course in the [Urban Spatial Analytics (MUSA)](https://www.design.upenn.edu/musa/about) program at the University of Pennsylvania. Students built custom web apps to explore and communicate research questions. Apps were built with the following tech stack:

* A PostgreSQL (with PostGIS) database running in AWS cloud
* Python Flask application with custom API endpoints
* Database access with SQLAlchemy
* HTML templating using Jinja2's integration in Flask
* Deployed using AWS Elastic Beanstalk
* BigQuery for OSM access among other large datasets (optional)
* API calls to Mapbox, Google Maps APIs, among others
